This Blender Add-On was created for a company to help automate rendering multiple sections of an animation in separate resolutions. The animation timeline is sectioned of in 'chunks', hence the name Render Chunkerer, and the user sets different resolutions for each chunk. When the user hits Render it will iterate through the chunks and save them in their respective resolutions to the specified Directory.
