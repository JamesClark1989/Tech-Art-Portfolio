Ryan loved classical piano. Man he loved the works Glenn Gould. He would show me so many clips of his and gush over his playing

We both had the same Ibanez guitar. Jamming together was like having a twin brother.

Ryan loved to skate. He tried teaching me but I could never get the hang of it.

We were obsessed in horror movies. We'd go down his backyard with a video camera and shoot our own blair witch. We would always scare each other and say "Dude! Did you hear that!?"

Ryan got very into reading. He had this huge collection of books that he'd stack up in a big pile after he read them. "I'm trying to reach the ceiling", he said.

We got into Marquis De Sade's works. Probably because we loved anything that was obscure and pushed the envelope.

We both adored adventure games. Particularly the Kings Quest series. We could never get very far so we faxed each other the guides to help each other out.

We loved playing video games. "When I finish my electrical engineering degree, we have to create an adventure game together like Kings Quest!", he said.
