# Hocus Pocus - PyGame Project

**About**

Hocus Pocus is a 2d platformer game created for DOS in 1994. This project attempts to recreate the first level of Hocus Pocus using Python and PyGame. It's made to show a deep understanding of Object Oriented Principles and Python programming.

**How to Play**
You must have the PyGame library and pytmx library installed.
Make sure you have a version of Python that's less than 3.11 as PyGame does not support 3.11

_Pip commands:_
pip install pygame
pip install pytmx

Open the project in your code editor and run.
