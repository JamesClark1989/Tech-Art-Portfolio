Run main.py in your IDE of choice to run the app.

Drag the mouse over the green squares where the capital cities are to get weather data pulled from API.

*Note*
The weather data is pulled from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs).
The weather data from this API seems to be a bit inaccurate compared to BOM. E.g. rainfall data seems to be off by 1-2 mm.
